## Tips

1. Please don't format code that isn't yours. Only format code that you have written.
2. In Vue files, keep the template at the bottom and the script at the top. `<script>` at the top, and `<template>` at the bottom. Keeping it this way ensures consistency and readability. No one likes to see HTML when they open up a file, eww...
3. **VERY IMPORTANT** Make your own feature branches through git in your local machine, work in that branch only, then once done, commit all your changes with clean comments and then push into your branch. Once pushed, it will appear on GitHub and you can create a pull request for someone to review.
